								<h2 class="alt">CoinHop Game</h2>
								<p>The project is a single-player, arcade-style, physics-based video game. 
                                    It puts the player in control of a ball atop a platform. 
                                    The players goal is to collect all the coins on the starting platform to ascend to the next. 
                                    The platform tilts as the ball rolls around on it, so the player needs to ensure that the ball doesnâ€™t roll off the platform. 
                                    For the player to beat the game, they need to collect all the coins on the final platform.

								<h3>About this project</h3>
							</header>

							<p>
								This was my BSc Final Project. We had numerous template projects to choose from, 
                                and I chose the Unity Arcade-style game. <br>
								The criteria for the game were that it resembled that of a
                                80s/90s arcade game, being challenging but compelling, and encourage repetitive for mastery.<br><br>

								It was recommended that we do a 2D game due to the time restrictions of the project, 
								but I already had some experimental 3D prototypes of this game from other modules in my studies, 
								so I decided to double-down on them and turn it into a full game.<br><br>

								The game mechanics are easy to learn, but difficult to master. 
								This is because players needs to gain the fundamental understanding that a state of flow needs to be maintained in order to prevail. 
								If the player tries to rush getting the coins, they will ultimately fail. 
								Instead, they need to flow with the platform and use its rotation as an aid, as opposed to a obstacle, in order to collect the coins. <br><br>

								This was a solo project, so I was the only contributor to development. 
								No 3rd party code assets were used. 
								I did, however, make use of free audio-visual assets on the Unity Store, such as music, textures, sound effects, and backgrounds. <br><br>
								
								I'm proud of the game that I produced. 
								I feel like it is cohesive and complete, and has a lot of potential for post-submission development. 
								It can easily be ported over to mobile or arcade platforms, and also further developed to include features like: 
									an in-game currency and store to unlock new levels, skins, and environments; 
									gyroscope control for mobile platforms;
